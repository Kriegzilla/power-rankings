WIP for Smash Bros Power Rankings for random asst of users

So far I've just got empty files and a User class, but eventually this'll work like a dynamic leaderboard based on user logins
(web app)
The plan is to have it so one user can say a game/match has been completed, fill in the info sheet for that game,
and submit it - this will ping the other user(s) involved in the game to sign off on it, and if they do then
it'll be added to their respective arrays of games and update the leaderboard accordingly.

For right now though, you can have a User with a name and a tag (like a username/nickname). That's it!
